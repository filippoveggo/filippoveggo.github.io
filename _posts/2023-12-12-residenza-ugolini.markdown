On behalf of an architecture firm in Padua, I have been commissioned to create and deploy a website for publishing their apartments in a residential complex. 
On the website, it is possible to contact the firm and view floor plans and dimensions of each housing unit.

Link to the website [here][Link-ResidenzaUgolini].
